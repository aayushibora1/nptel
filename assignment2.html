    <p>1.  The parameters obtained in linear regression</p>
    <label>
        <input type="radio" > can take any value in the real space<br>
        <input type="radio" >are strictly integers<br>
        <input type="radio" >always lie in the range [0,1]<br>
        <input type="radio" >can take only non-zero values<br>
<br>
    </label>
    <div<>Answer -<br>can take any value in the real space

        </div>
    <p>2. Suppose that we have N independent variables (X1,X2,...Xn) and the dependent variable is Y . Now imagine that you are applying linear regression by fitting the best fit line using the least square error on this data. You found that the correlation coefficient for one of its variables (Say X1) with Y is -0.005. </p>
    <label>
        <input type="radio" >   Regressing Y on X1 mostly does not explain away Y .<br>
         <input type="radio" > Regressing Y on X1 explains away Y .<br>
       <input type="radio" > The given data is insufficient to determine if regressing Y on X1 explains away Y or not.<br>
    
    </label><br>
    <div>
        Answer -<br>
        Regressing Y on X1 mostly does not explain away Y .

    <p>3. Consider the following five training examples<br>
        <img src="/photo/table4.jpg">

        <br>We want to learn a function f(x) of the form f(x)=ax+b which is parameterised by (a,b).Using mean squared error as the loss function, which of the following parameters would you use to model this function to get a solution with the minimum loss? </p>

            <input type="radio" >(1, 4)<br>
            <input type="radio" >(4, 1)<br>
            <input type="radio" >(3, 4)<br>
        </label><br>
        <div>
            Answer -<br>
            (1,4)

    <p>4.  The relation between studying time (in hours) and grade on the final examination (0-100) in a random sample of students in the Introduction to Machine Learning Class was found to be:
        Grade = 30.5 + 15.2 (h)<br>
        
         How will a student’s grade be affected if she studies for four hours?</p>
         <lable>
            <input type="radio" >  It will go down by 30.4 points.<br>
            <input type="radio" >It will go down by 30.4 points.<br>
            <input type="radio" >It will go up by 60.8 points.<br>
            <input type="radio" > The grade will remain unchanged.<br>
            <input type="radio" >It cannot be determined from the information given<br>

         </lable><br>
         <div>
            Answer -<br>It will go up by 60.8 points.</div>
    <p>5.  Which of the statements is/are True?</p>

    <p>6. Consider the following statements:<br>

        Assertion(A): Orthogonalization is applied to the dimensions in linear regression.<br>
        Reason(R): Orthogonalization makes univariate regression possible in each orthogonal dimension separately to produce the coefficients.</p>
    <label><br>
        <input type="radio"  > Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.<br>
        <input type="radio"> Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A.<br>
        <input type="radio" >A is true, but R is false.<br>
        <input type="radio" > A is false, but R is true.<br>
        <input type="radio" >Both A and R are false.<br>

    </label><br>
    <div>
        Answer -<br>
        Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.
    </div>
    <p>7.Consider the following statements:<br>

        Statement A: In Forward stepwise selection, in each step, that variable is chosen which has the maximum correlation with the residual, then the residual is regressed on that variable, and it is added to the predictor.<br>
        
        Statement B: In Forward stagewise selection, the variables are added one by one to the previously selected variables to produce the best fit till then<br></p>
        <lable>
            <input type="radio" >Both the statements are True.<br>
            <input type="radio"> Statement A is True, and Statement B is False <br>
            <input type="radio"> Statement A if False and Statement B is True<br>
            
            <input type="radio">Both the statements are False.<br>

    <p>8. The linear regression model y=a0+a1x1+a2x2+...+apxp is to be fitted to a set of N training data points having p attributes each. Let X be N×(p+1) vectors of input values (augmented by 1‘s), Y be N×1 vector of target values, and θ be (p+1)×1 vector of parameter values (a0,a1,a2,...,ap). If the sum squared error is minimized for obtaining the optimal regression model, which of the following equation holds?</p>
