    <p>1. There are n bins of which the k-th bin contains k−1 blue balls and n−k red balls. You pick a bin at random and remove two balls at random without replacement. Find the probability that:</p>
     <ul> <li> the second ball is red;</li>
    <li> the second ball is red, given that the first is red.</li>
    </ul>

       <p>2. A medical company touts its new test for a certain genetic disorder. The false negative rate is small: if you have the disorder, the probability that the test returns a positive result is 0.999. The false positive rate is also small: if you do not have the disorder, the probability that the test returns a positive result is only 0.005. Assume that 2% of the population has the disorder. If a person chosen uniformly from the population is tested and the result comes back positive, what is the probability that the person has the disorder?

       <p>3. In an experiment, n coins are tossed, with each one showing up heads with probability p independently of the others. Each of the coins which shows up heads is then tossed again. What is the probability of observing 5 heads in the second round of tosses, if we toss 15 coins in the first round and p=0.4?</p>
        <p> (Hint: First find the mass function of the number of heads observed in the second round.)</p>

      <p>5. An airline knows that 5 percent of the people making reservations on a certain flight will not show up. Consequently, their policy is to sell 52 tickets for a flight that can hold only 50 passengers. What is the probability that there will be a seat available for every passenger who shows up?</p>

       <p>9. You are given a biased coin with probability of seeing a head is p=0.6 and probability of seeing a tail is q=0.4. Suppose you toss the coin 10 times, what is the probability of you getting the head at most 2 times? Also, what is the probability of you getting the head for the first time on your fourth attempt?</p>
